## Explanation

BlocJams was a music player that was created to act as a Spotify type player. It was first created with JavaScript & then Angular. 

## Problem

I was brought on this project to create a web application with JavaScript that would run similarly to other music players.

## Solution


## Results

Pause and play songs, view playback progress, and adjust volume
Switch songs via previous and next buttons
Format the song playback and total time using a timecode filter


## Conclusion

This project was a 3 step process. We started by creating this project with plain JavaScript. It was then refactored with JQuery. The second mini project within Bloc Jams was to build the same app with Angular.
