## Explanation

Brew Jams is an application that was created to act as chat room. The end result of this application is to have it send and receive messages in real time.

## Problem

The goal of this project was to create a front-end web application that streamed music.

## Solution

This project was my first front-end web development application. This was created using plain JavaScript as well as then refactored using JQuery. Brew Jams is a streaming music player with media queries to determine a viewer's display dimensions and a responsive, grid-based user interface to provide an optimized look for various viewing device display sizes. The home page features text shadowing and CSS transition animations. Graphics from the Ionicons were used for the musical notes, radio wave, and mobile device images. The Collection page presents a set of albums. Each album reference includes artist, album title, song count, and album art. The Album page includes album data from the Collection page, plus a track list with track number, title, and duration. A player control with play/pause, previous, and next button, as well as a volume control feature appear at the bottom of the page. The Buzz audio library was used to load, play, and present audio files.


## Results

A music library and streaming player with a responsive design suitable for use on mobile devices and a bit of CSS transform animations


## Conclusion

This project involved both plain Javascript and the JQuery library to create an online music streaming web app. I learned how to use CSS and HTML to structure a basic web page and applying Javascript functionality to my web site. i also learned how to implement the Buzz library to hold and present audio files.
